    <h2 id="article-1-header"> Our story</h2>
    <p id="article-1-text">Lucky Shrub is a family business that began its journey 30 years ago, born from the vision and passion of a young man named Michael Shrub.
Michael held a deep and special love for nature and plant life. He firmly believed that a greener Earth is not just more beautiful, but fundamental to making humanity happier and healthier.
Starting from a small, humble nursery, he dedicated his life not only to cultivating plants but also to fostering a public love for greenery. His commitment to "giving new life" to our planet was an inspiration to everyone, right up until his last day.
Today, we, his family, carry on his vision with the same dedication. Lucky Shrub has grown and evolved, but its heart remains the same. We carry Michael's legacy in every seed we plant and every customer we help to create their own small, green oasis.
For us, every plant that leaves our nursery is a promise for a healthier and more beautiful tomorrow, exactly as our founder envisioned it.
